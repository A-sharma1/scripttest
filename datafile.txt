Resolving network communication problems with UNIX clients

The following procedure is for resolving NetBackup communications problems, such as those associated with NetBackup status codes 54, 57, and 58. This procedure consists of two variations: one for UNIX clients and another for PC clients.

Note:
	

In all cases, ensure that your network configuration works correctly outside of NetBackup before trying to resolve NetBackup problems.

For UNIX clients, perform the following steps. Before you start this procedure, add the VERBOSE option to the /usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf file. Also, create a bpcd debug log directory on your server and clients and a bprd log directory on the server. During subsequent retries, the debug logs provide detailed debug information, which can help you analyze the problem.

Table: Steps for resolving network communication problems with UNIX clients

Step
	

Action
	

Description

Step 1
	

Test a new or modified confitguration.
	

If this configuration is a new or a modified configuration, do the following:

    Check any recent modifications to ensure that they did not introduce the problem.

    Ensure that the client software was installed and that it supports the client operating system.

    Check the client names, server names, and service entries in your NetBackup configuration as explained in the following topic:

    See Verifying host name and service entries in NetBackup.

    You can also use the hostname command on the client to determine the host name that the client sends with requests to the server. Check the bprd debug log (verbose) on the server to determine what occurred when the server received the request.

    Note the required NIS or DNS updates. Failure to update these services properly is a common source of network problems.

Step 2
	

Verify network connectivity.
	

Verify network connectivity between client and server by trying to ping the client from the server.

# ping clientname

Where clientname is the name of the client as configured in the NetBackup policy configuration, in /etc/hosts, and in NIS and DNS (if applicable).

For example, to ping a client that is named ant:

# ping ant    
    ant.nul.nul.com: 64 byte packets
    64 bytes from 199.199.199.24: icmp_seq=0. time=1. ms
    ----ant.nul.nul.com PING Statistics----
    2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet 
    loss round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max = 1/1/1

Also, try ping from the client to the server.

If ping succeeds in both instances, it verifies connectivity between the server and client. If ping fails, you have a network problem outside of NetBackup that must be resolved before you proceed.

Some forms of the ping command let you ping the bpcd port on the client as in the following command:

# ping ant 13782

Or

# ping ant bpcd

Step 3
	

Ensure that the client listens on the correct port for the bpcd connections.
	

Run one of the following commands (depending on platform and operating system):

netstat -a | grep bpcd
netstat -a | grep 13782
rpcinfo -p | grep 13782

If no problem occurs with the port, the results are similar to:
tcp 0 0 *.13782 *.* LISTEN

LISTEN indicates that the client listens for connections on this port.

If a problem occurs, this line does not appear. One of the following conditions may exist:

    /etc/services (or applicable NIS file) does not have the correct bpcd entry. The correct /etc services entry is:

    bpcd  13782/tcp    bpcd

    /etc/inetd.conf (or applicable NIS or DNS file) does not have the correct bpcd entry. The correct /etc/inetd.conf entry is:

    bpcd stream tcp nowait root /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd

    /etc/inetd.conf was changed but was not re-read. Correct this condition by running one of the following (whichever works):

    /bin/ps -ef | grep inetd
    kill -HUP the_inetd_pid

    Or

    /bin/ps -aux | grep inetd
    kill -HUP the_inetd_pid

On a Hewlett-Packard platform, use inetd -c to send a SIGHUP to inetd.

On an AIX client, use SMIT to verify that the InetServ object policy was updated with information about the bpcd process (/etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services information). If you use SMIT to modify the InetServ object policy, the inetexp command automatically runs. If you edit the InetServ object policy, run the inetexp command to export the InetServ object policy to the /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services files. This command keeps these files in sync with the InetServ object policy. Run the following command to inform the inetd daemon of the changes to its configuration file:

refresh -s inetd or kill -1 InetdPID

Step 4
	

Connect to the client through telnet.
	

telnet to bpcd on the client. If it succeeds, keep the connection until after you perform step 5, then terminate it with Ctrl-c.

telnet clientname 13782

Where clientname is the name of the client as configured in the NetBackup policy configuration, /etc/hosts, and also in NIS and DNS (if applicable).

For example,

# telnet ant bpcd
Trying 199.999.999.24 ...
Connected to ant.nul.nul.com.
Escape character is '^]'.

In this example, telnet can establish a connection to the client ant.

    If the telnet succeeds, then inetd on the client is configured correctly. It can pass its connection to bpcd and NetBackup should also be able to establish a connection.

    If telnet doesn't work, ensure that the inetd.conf file and /etc/services files on both the server and client are correct and match. By default, these are as follows:

    In /etc/services:

    bpcd  13782/tcp    bpcd

    In /etc/inetd.conf:

    bpcd stream tcp nowait root /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd bpcd

    Then, run kill -HUP to reread the /etc/inetd.conf file as explained in step 3.

    Also, update the applicable NIS or DNS files.

    If these files are correct and you cannot connect to the client, you may have problems with the network routing or the port assignment. (See the next step.)

Step 5
	

Ensure that the client listens on the correct port for the telnet connection to bpcd.
	

Run one of the following commands (depending on platform and operating system).

netstat -a | grep bpcd
netstat -a | grep 13782
rpcinfo -p | grep 13782

The value 13782 could also be the value that is specified during installation.

One of the following conditions occurs:

    If the port is not the problem, you see the following:

    tcp 0 0 ant.nul.nul.com.13782 whale...com.1516 ESTABLISHED
    tcp 0 0 *.13782 *.* LISTEN

    Where ESTABLISHED indicates that the telnet connection was established to bpcd through port 13782 on the client. LISTEN indicates that the client listens for further connections on this port.

    Change the port number for bpcd or other NetBackup services only if there is no alternative. All NetBackup servers and clients in the configuration must use this new port assignment.

    If a process other than bpcd uses the port, try to reboot the client to clear the problem. If the problem is still not fixed, you may need to change one of the service numbers (preferably for the other service). To change a service number, modify the /etc/services files Then send SIGHUP signals to the inetd processes on your clients.

    /bin/ps -ef | grep inetd
    kill -HUP the_inetd_pid

    Or

    /bin/ps -aux | grep inetd
    kill -HUP the_inetd_pid

    On a Hewlett-Packard platform, use inetd -c to send a SIGHUP to inetd. Also make applicable NIS or DNS updates.

    If the problem is with an AIX client and you make changes to the /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services information, use SMIT to verify that the InetServ object policy was updated. See step 3.

Step 6
	

Verify communication between the client and the master server.
	

To verify client to master server communications, use the bpclntcmd utility. When -pn and -sv run on a NetBackup client, they initiate inquiries to the NetBackup master server (as configured in the client bp.conf file). The master server then returns information to the requesting client. More information is available about bpclntcmd.

See About the bpclntcmd utility.

Installation | Operation | BackupExec
Installation

Procedures of setting up Netbackup?

    configure robots
    add tape drives
    configure volume pools
    add volumes to the volume pools
    define a class for clients
    make a backup schedule the clients

How to add clients to Netbackup?

    You add clients to Class. From Administrative GUI, Backup Policy Management --> Class --> Clients --> New.
        Be default, Veritas Netbackup requires all backup image in the tape MUST have the same retension level. So make sure the Retension Level is consistant with the target Volume Pool.
    To install client software from Unix server, make sure rsh (or the trust) is enabled from the NetBackup server to the NetBackup client then right-click on the Master Server and select Install UNIX Client Software.
    If rsh (or a trust) is not enabled, then you will need to use /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/install_client_files ftp clientname username.
        In all above 2 methods, make sure /usr/openv/netbackup/bp.conf has correct FQDN server name sepcified. Sometime install program only give a short host name, which often can not be resolved and you will get 'connection refused' error.
        Make sure client & server names are all in /etc/hosts on both sides and resolvable.
    To install client from client side (or Jumpstart installation):
        Install tarball
        Modify $NETBACKUP/bp.conf with correct SERVER & CLIENT_NAME
        Add entries for Netbackup in /etc/inetd.conf & /etc/services, restart inetd

How to setup Linux Redhat 7.x client with Netbackup?

    Make sure firewall is not started. Stop ipchains and add necessary rules later if it needs to stay. This will open ports for Netbackup client's daemons.
    Make sure Redhat 7.x BSD r-commands (rsh & rlogin) services are started. For security reasons, these services need to be started in order for Master server to push the client installation package. Make sure root can rsh from master to Redhat client without supplying password. Close r-services after installation.
    Modify /usr/openv/netbackup/client/Linux/Redhat/install_client script if it is necessary. Redhat since version 7.0 has replaced inetd with xinetd and most services startup scripts have been moved to /etc/xinetd.d directory. Customized install_client script to make it working with xinetd.
    Install client either by running install_client or from GUI (xnb). Check install_client script if there is any error. Check the log file under /usr/openv/netbackup/log/bpcd for more specific errors.
    Add /etc/xinetd.d/bpcd file as follow: More details can be obtained from Veritas website.
        # bpcd is the service for the NBU program.
        service bpcd
        {
        disable = no
        socket_type = stream
        wait = no
        user = root
        server = /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd
        }
    Modify /etc/services file to add more entries for netbackup daemons. (if it is not added by install_client script).
    kill -HUP <xinetd pid> and netstat -a | grep bpcd to ensure bpcd is listening.

How to grant non-root users to use Java Administrative Interface?

    In the master server, create a system group which contains the user who will login in through Java administrative interface;
    /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nonroot_admin, specify the group which is just created.
    Change the NetBackup-Java authorization file, /usr/openv/java/auth.conf, to provide the desired capabilities for the affected users. For example, to provide Activity Monitor & Device Monitor capability, add: neilsu ADMIN=DM+AM.
    For more details, refer to Netbackup System Administrator's Guide.

How to grant user to use Netbackup Administration Client?

    Symptom: Could not connect to Master Server from Administrative Client, received "The list of Storage Units could not be retrivied, status:37 operation requested by an invalid server".
    You have to make sure that your administrative client is in the bp.conf file of the master server as: SERVER=administrative client name and in your vm.conf file as: KNOWN=administrative client name.

How to report media status (bpmedialist & vmquery)?

    bpmedialist -summary --> list a summary of all active & inactive media with expiration date
    bpmedialist -L/-l -p <VolumePool> --> report of media ID belong to this pool (-L or -l option will product Long & Short format).
    bpmedialist -mcontents -ev <media id> --> report contents on specified media (media will be loaded into drive and it will take a LONG TIME to complete).
    bpmedialist -mlist -ev <media id> --> report summary on specified media
    bpmedialist -rl <retention level> --> report media that are using this retention level. Default retention level are:

Alternate-Client Restore in Netbackup

NBU in nature has given more consideration to security & human error than OmniBack. In OBII, you can restore any clients from Administrative Client, but in NBU, you can:

    Restore any files from NBU media server back to original clients;
    Restore files from backup clients to Administrative Clients (alternative-client restore);
    Running command from one client to restore files belonging to other clients (alternative-client restore).

You can not run Administrative Client to restore files from one client to another client (except files belonging to AC itself). This is more secure and different than OBII.

Some procedures to setup Alternative-Client.

    Allowing All Clients to Perform Alternate-Client Restores
        The administrator can allow all clients to restore backups belonging to other clients by creating the following file on the NetBackup master server:
            /usr/openv/netbackup/db/altnames/No.Restrictions
        For example, assume that a user on a UNIX client named freddie wants to restore a file that was backed up by a client named oscar:
            The administrator creates the following file on the master server:
            /usr/openv/netbackup/db/altnames/No.Restrictions
            The user on freddie changes the NetBackup client name setting in the client user interface on freddie to oscar. Backup, Archive and Restore -> Actions -> Specify Netbackup Machines -> Clients -> Configure Current Client to be the client where files have been backup.
            Then, you can restore oscar files to your local machine.
    Only Allowing a Single Client to Perform Alternate-Client Restores
        The administrator can give a single client permission to restore backups belonging to other clients by creating an empty file named
            /usr/openv/netbackup/db/altnames/ peername
        for the client that is to have the restore privileges. This file must be on the master server.

BackupExec

Replace the BackupExec Database

    The database is standard SQL database, which contains /media servers/jobs/media/device information.
    Stopped all BE services and SQL Server(BKUPEXEC) service.
    In C:\Program Files\Symantec\Backup Exec\Data, renamed 2 db files: bedb_log.ldf & bedb_dat.mdf
    Copied new databases files into above location and start SQL & BE services.

Procedure to start 'bpcd' in standalone mode if it does not respond to connection attempts.

Solution


Sometimes it happens that bpcd appears to be 'listening' but does not respond to connection attempts.
The netstat -a command shows bpcd listening:

netstat -a | grep bpcd
     *.bpcd               *.*                0      0 24576      0 LISTEN

But bpcd does not respond to connection attempts, and there is no log produced in the bpcd log directory.

This could be because of some problem with the OS or the inetd process. This may occur when there is a security wrapper in the inetd.conf configuration file. This is an OS problem to be solved by the system administrator. For a quick fix they can remove the security wrapper for bpcd, if they are using one.

Check the /etc/inetd.conf file. You might see a line for bpcd that looks something like:

bpcd    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/sbin/tcpd    /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd

Comment out the line with the 'wrapper' and add the line as configured by NetBackup:

# bpcd    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/sbin/tcpd    /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd
bpcd    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd bpcd

Stop all the VERITAS NetBackup (tm) processes:

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/goodies/bp.kill_all

Re-read the inetd.conf file:

ps -ef | grep inetd
kill -HUP {inetd_pid}

Restart NetBackup. Try to connect to the bpcd daemon, or try a backup.

telnet {hostname} bpcd

If the connection to bpcd still cannot be established (or there is no security wrapper), the bpcd process can be run in 'standalone' mode as a workaround.

You might not be able to start the bpcd process because it cannot bind to port 13782. In that case, you will get a message:

bpcd -standalone
bind(13782) failed: 125

The following steps will allow bpcd to be started in standalone mode.

Edit the /etc/inetd.conf file by commenting out the bpcd line:

# bpcd    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/bpcd bpcd

Stop all the NetBackup processes:

/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/goodies/bp.kill_all

Re-read the inetd.conf file:

ps -ef | grep inetd
kill -HUP {inetd_pid}

Now bpcd will not be listening. You will be able to start it in standalone mode with:

bpcd -standalone

Restart NetBackup. Try to connect to the bpcd daemon, or try a backup.

telnet {hostname} bpcd

The system administrator will have to fix the inetd function for a permanent fix. But this will get backups running.
